# DC Restaurant Violation Forecasting
This is a prototype of replicating Chicago's Food Inspection Forecasting project with DC data in python.

## Overview
In 2014, the Department of Innovation and Technology for the city of Chicago built an algorithm to [predict likely health code violations](http://chicago.github.io/food-inspections-evaluation/) for restaurants based on publicly available data. They turned this into an open source project, freely available on [github](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation), so other cities could implement this model.  

As of an early 2016 article published by [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/predictive-policing-food-poisoning/423126/) only one other place in the country has taken advantage of Chicago's work to implement this model for their locality, Montgomery County, MD. With the assistance of [Open Data Nation](http://www.opendatanation.com/) the model has been adapted to work in a different environment. Montgomery County is comprised of 500 square miles of urban, suburban, and rural territory.

Open Data Nation is expanding this experience to build a data product called [**FIVAR**](http://www.fivar.org/), a web application that uses real-time open data to make food inspection smarter.  

This objective of this project is to replicate the process in Washington, DC using Python as a proof of concept project. This was undertaken as a Capstone project by [Nicole Donnelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoleadonnelly) and [Jonathan Boyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanboyle3) as part of the [General Assembly Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) This project has not been coordinated with the District of Columbia government.
